# SUBI Unlock v1.0.4

**SUBI Unlock** is a lightweight, offline tool for restoring access to PDF documents that you created but can no longer edit or print — because you’ve forgotten your own permission password.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This tool is intended **only for personal documents** where:
- You previously set editing/printing restrictions
- You’ve since **lost or forgotten** the permission password
- You still have access to **open and view** the file

It is **not intended** for removing restrictions from PDFs you do not own or have legal rights to modify.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🖱️ Drag & Drop interface — no technical skills required
- 🔓 Unlock editing, printing, and copying permissions
- 📁 No file size limit — handles large PDFs
- 🖥️ Fully offline — runs locally without uploading files
- 🚫 No installation required — portable .exe file

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ Cannot open PDFs that require a password to view
- ❌ Cannot remove DRM (Digital Rights Management)
- ✅ Only works on files you can already open but cannot modify
